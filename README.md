# my_portfolio

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a web application from scratch. The objective of this web page is to display the creator's "About Info", "Work" and "Contact Info" with relative links to each section. 
This portfolio of work is the start of what will showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

In this project I learned how to costruct a basic landing page from scratch. Within this page, I hade to create three sections; 'About Me', 'Work' and 'Contact Info'. I found it challenging to keep track of all the different elements that needed to be linked to the CSS sheet in order for the effects to work. I aim to keep building and adjusting to the page as the weeks continue, in which I can resolve some of the display bugs and further the layout.
